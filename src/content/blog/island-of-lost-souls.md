## **Review**

What does it mean to be human? Do our appearance, behavior or conscience play a part in forming humanity as we know it or can it be stitched together and whipped into subjugation? The Island of Lost Souls explores the worst in man’s hubris, to impose oneself as god and to conduct horrid experimentation on animals in the name of “Scientific Advancement”. The animals experimented on are left as confused husks of their former selves, unable to fully be of the human or animal world, simply existing as things, as unnatural abominations. Knowing nothing but to obey and the pain they will receive had they refuse, they live in constant fear and follow the mantra forced upon them; to not eat meat, walk on all fours, and spill blood. To behave as humans yet be treated as savage, feral animals. Throughout this, the creator attempts to deceptively create intimacy between one of his experiments with a man in hopes of testing whether they are capable of reproducing with humans. It is after their self-imposed god performs an act of hypocrisy; ordering to take a life, that the image of perfected humanity is shattered, and the animals revolt and execute their creator.
