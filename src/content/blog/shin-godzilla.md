## **Review**

A politicial satire which critiques governmental indecisiveness during times of crisis namely that of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Leaning heavily into dialogue heavy courtroom dramas with slight sprinkles of the kaiju sub-genre, Shin Godizilla harkens back to the original with Godzilla as the enemy while several politicial undertones are scattered across the film along with the eventual dilemma of using nuclear power to avert the looming threat of Godzilla. Moreover, Godzilla is used very sparingly, allowing the ensemble to shine with small yet cumulative input to stop Godzilla, which also adds greater weight to whenever the king of the monsters does appear. Furthermore, the film does not have a singular main emotional anchor but rather a collective as to showcase its themes of collectivism and human ingenuity while they persevere to stop Godzilla. To conclude, Shin Godzilla is a sincere yet modern take on the king of the monster and while it may not be a traditional Godzilla film nor the most exhilarating, it certainly is the most fascinating and engaged any film in the franchise has gotten thus far.
